Crashtronaut is a 2D sidescrolling platformer about an unlucky 
astronaut who crashes his rocket on an alien planet, and now has to...
Collect parts and... Go somewhere... For some reason... In order to get
home.

HOW TO RUN
Have Python and Pygame installed and run main.py.

HOW TO PLAY
Either use a gamepad or a keyboard.
Jump = Z
Use rocket booster = Press Z again when you're at the top of your jump.
Movement = Arrow keys
Start = Enter

At this point, there aren't any original levels or anything. So there's 
not all that much to play through.
